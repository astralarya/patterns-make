**patterns-make** - Template patterns for Makefiles


## Installation

You can manually copy this repository, but it is better to clone it via `git` with

>git clone https://github.com/resultsreturned/patterns-shell.git

Then you can easily get updates with

>git pull


## Patterns

Each directory contains a barebones Makefile project.

You can make a tarball of a project by navigating to the project directory and using:

    make tar

to create a \*.tar.gz containing the project.
